# PaperHub

Welcome to PaperHub! This platform is designed to assist researchers in enhancing their research papers with catchy titles and interactive features. 

## Overview

PaperHub enables researchers to submit their papers and receive engaging titles generated by our system using two advanced models:
1. **Abstract-Based Model**: Generates titles based on the abstracts of the submitted papers.
2. **Context-Enriched Model**: Incorporates various contexts, including internet search results and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based similarity searches, to create more refined and relevant titles.

Additionally, PaperHub provides interactive features such as:
- **Internet and RAG-Based Chat Options**: For real-time improvements to research content.
- **Multilingual Voice Chat**: Simplifies communication, ensuring accessibility and efficiency.
